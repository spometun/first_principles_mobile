      General Observations
      </strong>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Apostles were able to pass on the gifts because they were apostles.  The Apostles possessed the ability to perform miracles even during the ministry of Christ&nbsp;(

            are not the directives on how to receive tongues (the church there had already received them), but rather the correctives on how to use them because everyone was speaking at the same time and misusing the tongues&nbsp;

            </strong>
            shows that tongues as a gift were not given to everyone in the church.  Thus the concept of a "Pentecostal church" (every member speaking in tongues) is contrary to Scripture

            :&nbsp;"Perfection" here could not mean the coming of Christ because it is in the neuter gender in Greek, not the masculine gender.  When perfection comes probably refers to the canonization of the Bible some time after the first century.  At that time, all the miraculous gifts would be gone because all the apostles and those to whom they passed the gifts would have died

                  Now the Bible fulfills these needs — thus the church today does not need apostles or miraculous gifts
