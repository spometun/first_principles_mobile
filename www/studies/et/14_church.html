Other noted reformers were John Calvin (Presbyterian Church), Ulrich Zwingli and Conrad Grebel (Anabaptists). Anabaptists were heavily persecuted by Catholics and some reformers, because of their stand for adult baptism. Henry VIII (Anglican Church / Church of England) He breaks from the Catholic Church over his right to divorce his wife. He appoints himself head of the church.

In reaction to Catholicism, their congregations are autonomous — self-governing.

            A local congregation is called the "visible church."  In the first century, all the "visible churches" made up the "church universal."

         <li>
            The Greek word for church is "ekklesia" which means "assembly" or "called out" ("Ek" meaning 'out' and "kaleo" meaning 'to call').  To be a disciple is to be "called out" from the world.  Therefore, the church in the Bible was the "assembly" of the "called out"

            There are several names in the Bible for God's Church: Disciples, Christians, Church of God, Church of Christ, The Way, Church of the Firstborn, Saints, etc...  Since we are free to choose any name for our fellowship, since our fellowship goes around the world, and because our churches are composed of only sold-out disciples, we call ourselves the "International Christian Church"

      <strong>
      What distinguishes the International Christian Churches? (What separates or "divides" us from mainstream Christendom?)
      </strong>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <strong>
            We believe God physically resurrected Jesus from the dead
            </strong>
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>
            We believe the Bible is inspired by God and is our sole authority
            </strong>
             Therefore, since we have not departed (divided) from the truth, we consider ourselves non-denominational
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>
            We are a Bible Church, not simply a New Testament Church
            <a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/2-timothy-3-14-17.html" id="link.2-timothy_3:14-17">
            2 Timothy 3:14-17
            </a>
            </strong>.
            &nbsp;The context of the word "Scripture" is referring to the Old Testament.  We believe the Old Testament applies to our lives — as much as the New Testament — except for the Mosaic Law and any teaching in the New Testament that supercedes the Old Testament (Example: grounds for divorce)
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>
            We believe — as in the book of Acts — the visible church should be composed of only sold-out baptized disciples
            </strong>
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>
            "Be silent where the Bible speaks, and speak where the Bible is silent"
            </strong>
            In applying Scriptural principles to build the visible church, we believe we must obey God's Word, but where the Bible does not prohibit a practice or name, we are free to use our God-given creativity&nbsp;

            Genesis 2:19
            </a>
            </strong>
            (Examples: The principles for "Bible Talks," "Lead Evangelist," "Discipleship Partners" and "Regions" are in the Scriptures, though these terms are not.  However, nowhere are they prohibited.  Also instrumental music and paid Women's Ministry Leaders are not prohibited in the Scriptures)
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>
            We believe in a Central Leadership
            </strong>
            &nbsp;Throughout God's Word, when His people were unified, there was a strong central leadership and godly central leader.  (Examples:  Moses, Joshua, David and of course Jesus and the Apostles)&nbsp;

            </strong>
            teaches that local congregations had an overseeing evangelist, who unified the disciples "everywhere in every church." In the first century, congregations were a collective movement — not autonomous, not self-governing)
